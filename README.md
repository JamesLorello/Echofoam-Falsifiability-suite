# Echofoam-Falsifiability-suite
Scientific challenge suite for testing Echofoam Theory (emergent c, BAOs, redshift)
# Echofoam Falsifiability Suite

This repository contains a simplified simulation framework designed to test the Echofoam Theory of cosmological structure formation.

**Purpose:**  
To allow open, scientific attempts to *falsify* the theory by evaluating its predictions under clean, documented conditions.

**Included Tests:**
- Emergent `c` (causality propagation without injected constants)
- BAO ring emergence via foam burst tension
- Redshift via tension drag ("Echoshift")

**Why?**  
If Echofoam holds up to scrutiny, it may offer a new pathway to understanding cosmic memory, emergence, and tension as foundational to structure.

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements
